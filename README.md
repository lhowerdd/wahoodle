# wahoodle
This project is a wordle spinoff featuring UVA terminology. All that is required to run this project are the two python files and the pygame files in the repository and the pygame library. Gamebox.py is not my own code and is sourced from the UVA Computer Science department, more can be read about it here: https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~up3f/cs1110/supplement/gamebox-overview.html
